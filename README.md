# E-Waste Reduction Platform

## Overview

Our idea is to create a comprehensive e-waste reduction platform that addresses the growing problem of electronic waste and promotes responsible consumption practices. The platform will serve as a hub for individuals to buy, sell, donate, and responsibly dispose of used electronic products.

## Features

1. Online Marketplace

   We developed a user-friendly marketplace where individuals can create accounts and list their used electronic products for sale. Users will have access to various product categories, search filters, and sorting options to easily find specific items.

2. Community Forum

   Our platform include a community-driven Q&A forum where users can ask questions, seek advice, and share knowledge about reducing e-waste.

3. Donations

  Our platform will enable smooth communication between donors and recipients to coordinate logistics and ensure a successful donation process.

4. Interactive Map

   To enhance accessibility, we will integrate an interactive map feature into our platform. This feature will help users locate nearby drop-off points, recycling centers, repair services, and donation centers.
